INTERROGATION MINUTE 1934, December 4, I, Deputy People&#39;s Commissar of Internal Affairs - AGRANOV, interrogated citizen Leonid Vasilyevich NIKOLAEV as an accused and he testified in response to the questions asked: QUESTION: What influence did your connections with former oppositionist Trotskyists have on your decision to kill comrade KIROV? ANSWER: My decision to kill comrade KIROV was influenced by my connections with the Trotskyists: SHATSKY, Vanya KOTOLYNOV, Nikolai BARDIN and others. However, I knew these people not as members of a group, but individually. I met with these people over a number of years and, in particular, recently. I have not met the SBARDINS recently. QUESTION: Did these persons take part in your crime? ANSWER: No, they did not. Around August of this year, when I was conducting daytime surveillance of the house where Kirov and Chudov lived on Krasnykh Zori Street, I met Shatsky. He complained to me about his isolation from the Party and his dissatisfaction. He said that another in his place would be ready for anything. At the time of our conversation, Chudov, the Regional Committee Secretary, drove by in car No. 713. Chudov was driving from work to his dacha in Sestroretsk. Comrade Chudov&#39;s car paused at the tram stop and then drove on. We noticed this car and exchanged glances. I saw Skotolynov at the Polytechnic Institute in Leningrad before the October holidays (November 4), but we did not talk. Not long before, I had a meeting with Sokolov, a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in Smolny. From Smolny we took the tram to the Vyborg side, home. SOKOLOV has close ties with former oppositionists. He is a student at the Naval Academy. As a result of our conversation, we decided to establish closer relations. In Smolny, we wanted to get tickets to the gala meeting at the Mariinsky Theater on November 6th. On November 5th or 6th, I wanted to make an attempt on KIROV&#39;s life, but I then postponed my intention in connection with the October holidays. Our conversation with SOKOLOV was of a mutual feeling out nature. SOKOLOV lives on Nizhegorodskaya Street. He graduated from an industrial technical school. L.
