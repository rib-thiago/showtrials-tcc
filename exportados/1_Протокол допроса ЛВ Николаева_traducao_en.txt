INTERROGATION MINUTES OF NIKOLAEV Leonid Vasilievich, December 3, 1934 QUESTION: How did you get to Smolny on December 1? ANSWER: I got in with my party card. QUESTION: When did you arrive at Smolny? ANSWER: Around 1:30 PM and stayed there until 2:30 PM, then left and returned at 4:30 PM. QUESTION: How did you spend that first hour in the Smolny building? ANSWER: First, I turned to Comrade DENISOVA, the regional committee instructor, who is stationed next to another employee, PLATONOVSKAYA. I have known DENISOVA personally since 1923. I asked her for a ticket to a party activist meeting, but she refused, as she explained to me, because she didn&#39;t have any tickets. Later, on the same third floor, I met SHITIK-SHNEYERSON, an employee of the City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (newspaper sector). I also asked her for a ticket and was told that she didn&#39;t have one herself. Down the same corridor, I then met LARIN, the responsible instructor of the city committee, and from LARIN I asked for a ticket to the activist meeting, but was also refused. Afterwards, I met SMIRNOV, the head of the party personnel sector of the regional committee. Outside his office, I asked for a ticket and was told that he, SMIRNOV, had nothing to do with ticket distribution. SMIRNOV directed me to room 450 to get a ticket, but I didn&#39;t go there, as I knew I had no personal acquaintances in that room. I then went to see PETROSHEVICH, the secretary of the agricultural group, and entered his office, located on the left side of a large corridor. I chatted with him for about five minutes, initially on general, inconsequential topics, and then also asked for a ticket. PETROSHEVICH told me that he currently had eight tickets and that if any remained, he would give them to me. For this purpose, PETROSHEVICH asked me to come back in the evening. Then I went downstairs, left the Smolny building, and strolled for an hour along Tverskaya Street, Ochakovskaya Street, came out onto Sovetskaya Street, and returned to Smolny. Having climbed to the third floor, I went into the restroom, relieved myself, and, emerging from the restroom, turned left. After taking two or three steps, I saw Sergei Mironovich Kirov walking toward me along the right wall of the corridor, about 15-20 paces away. When I saw Sergei Mironovich Kirov, I first stopped and turned my back on him, so that when he passed me, I was looking at his back. After letting Kirov walk 10-15 paces ahead of me, I noticed that there was no one for a considerable distance. Then I followed him, gradually catching up. When Kirov turned the corner to the left toward his office, the layout of which I knew well, the entire half of the corridor was empty. I ran up to him, about five paces away, pulled my revolver from my pocket as I ran, aimed the barrel at Kirov&#39;s head, and fired a single shot into the back of his head. Kirov instantly fell face down.
I turned back to prevent an attack on myself from behind, cocked the hammer and fired, intending to hit myself in the temple, at the moment I cocked the hammer a man in a GPU uniform jumped out of the office opposite, and I hurried to shoot myself. I felt a blow to the head and fell. When I came to and gradually began to come to my senses, I thought that I was about to die, someone ran up to me, they began to examine me and carried me into a room. Recorded from my words correctly, read to me. L. NIKOLAEV INTERROGATED: Deputy head. OO GUGB - SOSNOVSKY CORRECT: RGASPI F. 671, Op. 1, D. 114, L. 6-7. Published: Echo of a shot in Smolny.
